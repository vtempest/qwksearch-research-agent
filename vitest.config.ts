/**
 * Root Vitest project registry.
 *
 * Replaces the old `vitest.workspace.ts`: Vitest 4 dropped support for the
 * workspace file, so that config was silently ignored and a root `vitest run`
 * fell back to globbing every test file with no per-package settings.
 *
 * Each entry points at a package's own `vitest.config.*`, which owns its
 * environment, include globs and coverage scope. Packages that use a
 * different runner are intentionally absent and run from their own scripts:
 * `domain-rank` and `extract-pdf` (bun test), `extract-youtube` (jest) and
 * `language-model-training` (pytest).
