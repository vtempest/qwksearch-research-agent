/**
 * Build every `packages/*` that has a `build` script, in dependency order.
 *
 * `apps/qwksearch-web` consumes its siblings through their built `dist/`, and
 * its `prebuild` used to name them in a hand-written `cd ... && bun run build`
 * chain. That chain listed `research-agent-ui` *before* `reason-editor` and
 * `reason-editor-sidebar`, two packages whose types it imports, so its
 * declaration build could not resolve them:
 *
 *   src/workspace/ResearchWorkspaceView.tsx: Cannot find module
 *   'react-reason-editor/reason-docs' or its corresponding type declarations.
 *
 * `bun install` links siblings into node_modules as symlinks, so one that has
 * not been built yet has no `dist/` and its `exports` -> `types` entries point
 * at files that do not exist. The npm publish workflow hit the same wall and
 * fixed it with `workspace-build-order.mjs` (see #386); this reuses that same
 * topological order rather than keeping a second hand-maintained list in sync.
 *
 * Turbo would also order these correctly from `turbo.json`'s
 * `dependsOn: ["^build"]`, but its graph counts a dependency as internal only
 * when the declared range matches the workspace copy. `research-agent-ui` asks
 * for `use-voice-control: ^0.1.95` while the workspace sits at 0.1.93, so
 * turbo treats it as an ordinary registry dependency and never builds it.
 * `workspaceBuildOrder` keys local edges by package *name*, which is why it
 * covers that case and turbo does not.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build-workspace-packages.mjs
