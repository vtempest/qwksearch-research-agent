/**
 * `react-reason-editor/docs-agent` — the dual-editor workspace.
 *
 * Two implementations of the Reason Editor sit behind one product contract:
 *
 *   - `ReasonTiptapEditor` — the existing Tiptap stack, unchanged, kept as the
 *     control version.
 *   - `ReasonPlateEditor`  — the Plate starter's editor UI and plugin set.
 *
 * `ReasonPlaygroundEditor` is a third *surface*, not a third engine: the same
 * Plate editor and the same collaboration room as `ReasonPlateEditor`, wearing
 * the Plate playground's full toolbar instead of `ReasonToolbar`. It is what the
 * demo opens by default; the two toolbar-schema editors above are untouched and
 * stay reachable so the three can be compared side by side.
 *
 * Both render the same `REASON_TOOLBAR` schema through the same
 * `ReasonToolbar` renderer, and differ only in which `EditorToolbarAdapter`
 * they hand it — including the dictation button (`transcribe`), the
 * voice-commands plugin ported from the Tiptap side's `Transcribe` extension to
 * a new Plate plugin in `./docs-agent/plate/transcribe-controller.ts`. Their
 * Yjs rooms are namespaced per engine (`reason-editor:<engine>:<documentId>`)
 * because a ProseMirror document and a Slate document are not interchangeable;
 * they stay separate until there is an explicit conversion/export pipeline.
 *
 * `ReasonSidebar` (from `./docs-agent/shared`) is the third shared plugin: the
 * document navigation list both routes mount around their editor, backed by
 * the same document store the production file-tree uses.
